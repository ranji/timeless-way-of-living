# A Divided Mind

***I bow down to you.***

***When I bow down to you,***

***I bow down to my self.***

Have you ever analyzed your dreams, not just the content of the dream but the process behind it? 
Every dream requires a dreamer and a dream, a perceiver and an experience to perceive. 
The experience is made up of people and objects with which the dreamer can interact. 
The most interesting observation here is that there is only one mind involved. 
In order to dream, the mind must divide itself into a perceiver (you) and the dream world, which consists of objects, people, and events. 
Thus, the experiences and the perceiver are not two separate entities but rather one. 
Somehow, the mind is capable of creating a separation that allows the dreamer to feel as if they have an existence that is independent of the dream world. 
Without the sense of being an observer who is separate from the objects and people in the dream, the dream would not appear as real to the dreamer.
Furthermore, the dreamer would hold absolute sway over the dream – which is usually not the case.

Understanding how the mind divides itself during sleep can provide useful insight into the notion that this division also occurs when we are awake. 
Daydreaming serves as an example of this phenomenon. 
While this division is sometimes referred to as perception, the term does not fully reveal how the mind separates. 
In reality, the subtle division begins as soon as we begin to perceive the world around us.

For example, if you observe how immediately after you wake from a good night's sleep, 
the concepts of "I," my family, my job, my friends, and associated memories start flowing in, 
you'll see how in an instant your mind starts churning these thoughts to create divisions. 
In a broader sense, this division is quite evident in that you see the same person or the same situation in different lights on different days. 
One day you like a person or policy, the next day you are bored or you hate it.

*The divisive nature of the mind is boldly and blatantly at work while we are dreaming, and it continues to be ever present even after we wake up. 
In the ***real*** world, we often fail to recognize this because we are not awakened until we make a conscious effort. 
However, becoming aware of the divisive nature of the mind can liberate us from its limitations.*
