## Retire Your Self
***Is the seer the mind?***
***Who experiences being?***

Life poses innumerable challenges along the way. When
a challenge is particularly hard, it helps to ask yourself
questions about life in that context.
Here are some guidelines for getting the right answer -
first, don’t settle easily for answers that come your way.
For an answer to be true, for it to stick, it has to originate
from your own experience. If you ask a question and
accept someone else’s answer, you always fail to apply it
effectively in life.

Secondly, make sure that you take plenty of time to
frame your question appropriately. Ponder over it and ask
the same question in many ways. Don’t even think about
the answer for some time. In life, framing the right
question is more important than finding the answer. If
your question is right, the answer comes effortlessly.
Often, a lack of inquiring mind leads to a muddled
existence coupled with hopes of a better future for many
of us.

A common excuse that we have for postponing life and
enjoyment is retirement - we work hard now so that we
can relax later. This reasoning defies logic and inflicts pain
on the self. Instead, a guiding principle in life should be
that you accept you are retired first and then live. Life
becomes so much simpler after that.

We have heard the saying 'The journey is the
destination'. Having such an attitude towards life will
enable you to live without regrets. If you do not enjoy your
journey, your day-to-day life, you will never reach your
destination. In fact, you may not even realize that you've
reached your destination. 

A teachers of mine would oft repeat: 
>"Imagine that somebody picked you up and dropped you in your favorite vacation destination.
You have no memory of how you ended up there, 
you have no idea how you long you remain there before you are picked up again.
You could get picke up today or in a hunderd years.
What would you do? Relax and enjoy your vacation or brood about your past and future"

A mad scramble to reach
your goal forces you to regret later. People often say 'I
wish I could spend more time with my spouse, kids,
parents and friends'. If you live as if you are retired, then
there is no reason to postpone spending your time with
them. Is that not the idea anyways? That when you are
retired, you do things that you enjoy?
Take the same approach to work. Do work that you
like. Do not work for the sake of others, work as if you are
retired.

The human body is engineered to experience the world
around us in different ways. Aging is a beautiful
phenomenon that helps us do so. Your body seldom waits
for your mind to be ready. You can't enjoy a beach in your
90s the way you did as a kid, in your teens, 20’s, 30's, 40's
or even 80's. You change and therefore your experience of
the beach changes. So **live like you are retired** instead of
spending time anticipating retirement.

*** When you let your mind divide, you are snagged in
thoughts. Furthermore, being centered on your favorite
fiction called personality eventually leads to conflict. To
have a colorless mind that remains, not chasing memories
and day-dreams, is the best retirement you will have. ***
