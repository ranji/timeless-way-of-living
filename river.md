STEP IN STEP OUT

***A fisherman does not get his feet wet while fishing.***


Often we find ourselves so involved with our work that
we get angry, anxious, frustrated, and disappointed.
These are emotions that many of us go through which
is good, because these emotions almost always lead
to a
solution to a problem. However if you bring these
emotions home, it can affect your interaction with
friends
and family. On the other hand, if you take your pro
blems
at home to work, your quality of work suffers.
If your frustrations prevent you from listening and
responding to your spouse, kids, friends or colleag
ues and make you do or say things that you don't mean to, then
soon you will have a lifeless life.
When your mind is preoccupied with thoughts from a
different time, you miss the precious moment. The
thoughts that have roots in past events prevent you from
enjoying the present and therefore void the future.
Ironically, if you take a moment to reflect on how much
time you spend reflecting on your past, you will get an idea
of how much of life goes by in that time.
If you feel that your life has turned into a set of
frantic events, or if you feel like a person who is just going with
the flow, you need to realize that the flow is very
much a creation of your mind. There is nothing stopping you from
stepping out and observing the flow.
You can choose to not conform and not go by the
standards that others use to judge you.
These standards, mostly created by society, have value
only because they firmly exist in your mind. Reflec
ting on
this is true meditation. Understanding this gives you the
ability to gauge what is important, what is not and
allows you to navigate the flow of life with passion while
not
being affected by its surprises and uncertainties.
If money, social status and societal acceptance are
all
important to you, it is because you have accepted a
certain
scale of reference. It is painful for many to live by a scale
that is not their creation.
Instead create a scale of your own and
remove that pain. It is even better if you don't live by a scale. Do not
use others or their achievements as your reference points. It will bring
you pain and pride; never contentment.
This way of thinking may be interpreted as escapist
by people who live by existing social norms and do not
question what is and what is not. Ponder over this and you
will realize that you are not escaping from anything. You
still have to find a means to live, a place to sleep
and so on.
All you are doing is finding your true calling and
living contently. This so called ambition to make money or
getahead of others is no ambition at all - it is petty competition. True ambition is to find out what you
love,
do it and get better at it because you want to.
