# The Concept called Personality

What is a concept? we presumably understand abstract ideas like love, relationship and respect. 
We share these concepts at varying levels of abstraction to communicate effectively amongst ourselves. In a broader sense, abstract ideas and sold phyical objects are also a concept.  
To understand how our minds work with ideas and conceptualizes,  we should go from concrete to the abstract. For example, a bicylce I own is real 
but also a concept in my mind. It is a concept because when I think about a bike, it is blue and is a bicycle; but when you I ask you to picture a bike in your mind, 
it could be a motor-cycle of different color. We share a word, we share an idea, but details differ. Now by happenstance, 
if we were to look at the same bike and go through an exercise of describing it, we would do it very differently.
If this is the case with concrete objects, imagine the magnitude by which our opinions would differ when we speak of abstract concepts like love.

But why are concepts so important? As mentioned earlier, it does help with communication. Our species survived and 
built this society on a solid foundation of our ability to communicate. Commonality in perception enable effective communication 
and the variance in it is why many a communication fail.

Most of us already at some level know that we have concepts of real objects and then there are more abstract ones.
What we don't see but is in plain sight is the concept of personality. 
It is like our nose that our eye always see but out minds never register it presence. But unlike our nose,
your personality is the most important concept in your life. 
It is this concept that effects how you interpret situations and behave in pleasant or unpleasant circumstances. 
In fact, when others refer to your character, in reality it is behavior induced by a bundle of concepts that you hold dear. 
These concepts are so dear to you that you fail to see or question the assumptions and choices you make. 
This belief in the concept of your personality is immensely strong that when situations don't conform, your mind goes through conflict and unrest.

For instance, lets say that a man strongly believes that he is an honest man. If another person tells him what he says is not true, 
the man gets agitated thinking that he has just been called a liar. 
But maybe the other person was just pointing out a fact and not being judgmental. 
The idea that he is honest is so deeply rooted that he reacts violently. 
Perhaps if the other person had pointed to the facts instead of using an accusatory tone the reaction may have been different.

I have many friends who have names that are
uncommon in the country I live in. My own given name is
not a common one. So when I go to restaurants to get a
take-away, I often see the man behind the counter look at
the name on the receipt and hesitate to say it aloud. Often,
he looks up and around at the faces present, spots the
foreigner and then hands the bag over. This makes me 
smile and I mention to him jokingly that it’s a hard name
to say. However, I have friends who take offense if the
man behind the counter refuses to call out their names.
If we can leave aside the right and wrong of the
situation, you can see that the man hesitates because he
wants to either avoid making a fool of himself or
inadvertently insulting a customer by mispronouncing a
name. You can also see that the man with the uncommon
name might be upset because he was treated differently -
he’d rather have his name mispronounced than not called
at all. But assumptions on both sides lead to this funny
situation!

*Know that these concepts are important but don't be a prisoner to them. 
Be mindful of abstractions in life and their imperfections. 
Therefore, watch your personality with interest. See different
concepts at play. Question them and you will be less stubborn and less
concerned with other people’s opinions. You will also be able to adapt
to changing situations more easily like a river flowing around
unyielding boulders.*
