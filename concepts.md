# Concepts

What is a concept? Abstract ideas like love, relationship and respect. In a broader sense, everything is a concept. 
We share these concepts at varying levels of abstraction to communicate effectively amongst ourselves. 
To understand how our minds work with ideas and conceptualizes,  we should go from concrete to the abstract. For example, a bicylce I own is real 
but also a concept in my mind. It is a concept because when I think about a bike, it is blue and is a bicycle; when you think about it, 
it probably is a motor-cycle of different color. We share a word, we share an idea but details differ. Now by happenstance, 
if we were to look at the same bike and go through an exercise of describing it, we would do it very differently.
If this is the case with concrete objects, imagine the magnitude by which our opinions would differ when we speak of abstract concepts like love.

But why are concepts so important? As mentioned earlier, it does help with communication. Our species survived and 
built this society based on our ability to communicate. The commonality in our perception enable effective communication 
and the variance in it is why many a communication breakdown.

Most of us already at some level know that we have concepts of real objects and then there are really abstract ones.
What we don't see but is in plain sight is the concept of personality. 
It is like our nose that our eye always see but out minds never register it presence. But unlike our nose,
your personality is the most important concept in your life. 
It is this concept that effects how you interpret situations and behave in pleasant or unpleasant situations. 
In fact, when others refer to your character, in reality it is behavior induced by a bundle of concepts that you hold dear. 
These concepts are so dear that you fail to see tor question the assumptions and choices you have made. 
This belief in the concept of your personality is immensely strong that when situations don't conform, your mind goes through conflict and unrest.

For instance, lets say that a man strongly believes that he is an honest man. If another person tells him what he says is not true, 
the man gets agitated thinking that he has just been called a liar. 
But maybe the other person was just pointing out a fact and not being judgmental. 
The idea that he is honest is so deeply rooted that he reacts violently. 
Perhaps if the other person had pointed to the facts instead of using an accusatory tone the reaction may have been different.

Know that these concepts are important but don't be a prisoner to them. 
Be mindful of abstractions in life and their imperfections. 
Thus you will be able see the cause of conflict and be at peace.
