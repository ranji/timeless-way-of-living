# THOUGHT IS TIME

*Absolute stillness.
If you think about wavering, you have wavered already.*

Thought is time. Consider this. Every mystical practice, including atheism, recommends some form of self-reflection. 
It could be in the form of prayer, meditation, or a backpacking retreat through the mountains. 
Ultimately, this journey leads to introspection about the self and its actions. This practice is usually conducted in the absence of, or in the context of, a higher power. 
It's crucial for us as humans to allocate time for reflection, as it often leads to epiphanies and a natural refinement of our thought paradigm.

Let’s take meditation, for example. During meditation, you're typically asked to maintain prolonged focus on an object, an action, or a thought. Most of these techniques are designed to quieten the mind. 
**A quiet mind is aware, one pointed and relaxed.**

Now, when you observe your thoughts during reflection, you'll notice random, dormant, or occasionally unsettling thoughts emerging. 
These thoughts are all rooted in time and persist because they're founded on past experiences or fantasies, anticipation of the future. 
Thoughts have no way of taking root in the present moment. 
When you perceive an object through sight, smell, taste, sound, or touch, your brain instantly accesses your memory banks to interpret it. 
In social situations, your brain draws from similar past experiences to prepare for upcoming interactions. However, the process doesn't halt there. 
Your brain continually processes past occurrences and envisions future scenarios to shape your experience and provide comfort. 
This constant movement of your mind between the past and the future continually obscures your ability to perceive with **fresh eyes**.


So next time a thought arises, take time away from it, and you will witness it crumbling. 
What remains is an unfettered awareness, allowing you to see the world as it truly is. 
This is a fundamental principle for you to comprehend.
